<p>
    <strong>
        Shiva duti svarupena hata daitya mahabale
        <br>
        Ghora rupe maha rave Bhairavi namostute
        <br>
        <br>
        Lakshmi lajje maha vidye shraddhe pushti svadhe dhruve
        <br>
        Maha ratri maha vidye Bhairavi namostute
        <br>
        <br>
        Medhe vidya vare bhuti babhravi maha kali
        <br>
        Niyate tvam prasi deshe Bhairavi namostute
        <br>
        <br>
        Sarva svarupe sarva shakti samanvite
        <br>
        Bhaye bhya strahi no Bhairavi namostute
        <br>
        <br>
        Etat e mukham saumyam nayana traya bhushitam
        <br>
        Patu nah bhiti bhyah Bhairavi namostute
